 * Why parks so green?
 

Chris (6:56)

 * Points on points--only a problem of display?


Masha (7:11)

 * Mapbox Studio, tiling things as a textile designer


Sadra (7:30)

 * Not a lot of progress
 * Hasn't thought about precalculating, might
 * Planners said they'd like to see neighborhood-level maps / views


D3
 * Not a huge deal
 * Leaflet was enough
 * JavaScript was not quite far enough advanced to do it
 * SAVI should maybe do more JavaScript first

JS Bin
 * Useful
 * An index earlier would have been helpful
