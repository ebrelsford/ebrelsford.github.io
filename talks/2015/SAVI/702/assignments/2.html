            <h2>Part 1: A Small Scale Map</h2>
            <p>Pick a part of the world that you like or want to know more about. Download Natural Earth data to make a map of the region you chose. <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a> is a free-to-use and accurate data set for the whole world, and it is the go-to data for this type of task. You should be working at a smaller scale (that is, zoomed out), so you will likely be interested in the <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors">10m cultural</a> and <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors">10m physical</a> vector files, but feel free to use any that make sense for your map. All of the files are available on the <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth downloads page</a>.</p>

            <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
            <p>This work is due Wednesday, October 21st, at noon.</p>
            <p>Use the QGIS <strong>Print Composer</strong> to create <strong>one PDF</strong>. Make sure to add map accessories such as legends, titles, and scale bars as appropriate.</p>
            <p>Finally, include a <strong>short summary</strong> (1/2 page is fine) of what you did for this assignment. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>
            <p>I want to see that you are thinking about cartographic concepts as we discussed in class and that you are exploring QGIS's ability to make maps exported as PDFs.</p>
            <p>Please email me your summary and attach the PDF.</p>
