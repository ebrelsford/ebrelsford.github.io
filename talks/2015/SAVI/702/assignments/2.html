            <h2>A Small Scale Thematic Map</h2>
            <p>Pick a part of the world that you like or want to know more about and try your hand at making a thematic map of that area.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download Natural Earth data to make a map of the region you chose. <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a> is a free-to-use and accurate data set for the whole world, and it is the go-to data for this type of task. You will likely be interested in the <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors">10m cultural</a> and <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors">10m physical</a> vector files, but feel free to use any that make sense for your map. All of the files are available on the <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth downloads page</a>.</li>
                <li>Open the data in QGIS.</li>
                <li>Using the techniques described in the video above and discussed in class this week, layer the data in such a way that your <strong>theme</strong> is furthered. Example themes might be: disputed territory, Antarctic claims, and transportation infrastructure. You are free to find and incorporate other data, but it will be fine to stick with Natural Earth data for this assignment.</li>
                <li>While working on this map, use <strong>expressions</strong> in at least one way. Recall the parts of QGIS that allow you to use expressions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Select by expression, to select features that you want to pull out to another layer</li>
                        <li>Rule-based styles, to hide features or style specific features in a certain way</li>
                        <li>Data defined overrides, which let you specify a style using data from a shapefile (eg to make a marker larger based on a number in the shapefile)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Change your project properties to a <strong>projection</strong> that makes sense for the region you are looking at, and justify this in your submission. If you need help finding a good one, try <a href="http://projectionwizard.org/">Projection Wizard</a>.</li>
                <li>Export your map using the QGIS print composer and submit it via email along with an example of an expression you used while working on the map.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
            <p>This work is due Wednesday, October 28th, at noon.</p>
            <p>Use the QGIS <strong>Print Composer</strong> to create <strong>one PDF</strong>. Make sure to add map accessories such as legends, titles, cite data sources, and scale bars as appropriate.</p>
            <p>Finally, include a <strong>short summary</strong> (1/2 page is fine) of what you did for this assignment. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>
            <p>Don't forget to include the <strong>expression</strong>(s) you used and the <strong>projection</strong> you chose.</p>
            <p>Please email me your summary and attach the PDF.</p>
