            <h2>Guidelines</h2>
            <p>The final project counts for 50% of your grade for this course. It is an opportunity to use the skills you have learned in this course in service of a theme you are interested in.</p>
            <p>Pick a part of New York or some other part of the world and a mappable theme and make ten maps of that area and your theme.</p>
            <p>All final projects must consist of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>a theme that ties your maps/analyses together</li>
                    <li>a 6-8 minute presentation</li>
                    <li>maps should include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>One</strong> map with your selected area highlighted for geographic context (that is, to show the area in its regional context).</li>
                            <li><strong>One</strong> basemap of your selected area highlighting points of interest.</li>
                            <li><strong>One</strong> population density map of your selected area. If this is an area in the US, use Census data from 2010.</li>
                            <li><strong>Two</strong> other maps based on census variables (by census tract) from 2010 if in the US, else use other relevant demographic data.</li>
                            <li><strong>One</strong> map using geocoding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Two</strong> maps using geoprocessing and/or spatial analysis.</li>
                            <li>At least <strong>two</strong> other maps highlighting your theme.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
            <p>This work is due Sunday, July 17th at noon.</p>
            <p>At the end of the class we will make a portfolio for the class together. This will be a quick way to show others what happened in the class and for everyone to share their outcomes with each other. The portfolio site will be very similar to <a href="http://pratt-savi-800.github.io/spring2016/">this one created for SAVI-800</a>.</p>
            <p>With the above in mind, please submit the following via email:
                <ol>
                    <li>a single PDF of your maps (under 100MB),</li>
                    <li>a representative screenshot to use for your project, and</li>
                    <li>a short description of your project (1 to 3 paragraphs).</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
