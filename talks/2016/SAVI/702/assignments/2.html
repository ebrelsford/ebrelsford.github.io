            <h2>A Choropleth Map</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick a dataset containing points and a dataset containing polygons. For example, you could look at <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests/fvrb-kbbt">311 data</a> by <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/City-Council-Districts/yusd-j4xi">city council district in NYC</a> or <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">Airbnb Listings</a> by neighborhood for some city. If you have a project in mind, feel free to start working with relevant data. As always, email the group if you're having a hard time finding or using data.</li>
                <li>Filter the points in the dataset using one of the techniques we covered this week (filter the layer or select by expression and save to a new layer).</li>
                <li>Count the number of remaining points in each polygon.</li>
                <li>Calculate the density of the points in each polygon by dividing the counts by the areas of the polygons.</li>
                <li>Style the map using a <strong>graduated</strong> style.</li>
                <li>Export your map using the QGIS print composer and submit it via email along with the expression you used to filter your points while working on the map.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>Final project proposal</h2>
            <p>Prepare to present an idea for your <a href="finalproject.html">final project</a> on Thursday June 16th. Briefly research existing maps along this theme for inspiration and look for data you might be able to use for the project.</p>
            <p>The presentation is informal and is not expected to be longer than five minutes. You are encouraged but not required to bring a few slides (PDFs on a thumb drive or somewhere online is recommended) to illustrate your idea.</p>
            <p>Do not submit anything for this part of the assignment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
            <p>This work is due Sunday, June 12th, at midnight.</p>
            <p>Use the QGIS <strong>Print Composer</strong> to create <strong>one PDF</strong>. Make sure to add map accessories such as legends, titles, cite data sources, and scale bars as appropriate.</p>
            <p>Finally, include a <strong>short summary</strong> (1/2 page is fine) of what you did for this assignment. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>
            <p>Don't forget to include the <strong>expression</strong>(s) you used.</p>
            <p>Please email me your summary and attach the PDF.</p>
