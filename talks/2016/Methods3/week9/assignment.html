                <p>Write a page or two letting me know where you are with your project. You may want to include:</p>

                    <li>Screenshots of progress.</li>
                    <li>Data: Are you finding it? Do you need help finding specific data? Do you need help accessing data you have found?</li>
                    <li>Project structure: How has it developed? Do you need help clarifying it?</li>
                    <li>QGIS: Is there anything you may need to do in QGIS that we haven't covered sufficiently?</li>
                    <li>Online: Similarly, are there things you'd like to do online that we haven't gotten to?</li>
