                <p>This week we talked about another way to unlock more geographic data (<em>geocoding</em>) and a few other ways to represent density using QGIS (<em>heat maps</em> and <em>hex bins</em>). Use this assignment to get familiar with at least one of these and make another map in QGIS before we move to putting maps online next week.</p>

                <h2>Part 1: Project Description</h2>
                <p>For Assignment 4, Part 1, you submitted a few ideas for a final project. Pick one this week to explore (I will do my best to get feedback to you on these soon). You're not stuck with this project yet, but develop it to see how it feels. Please do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consider a few types of <strong>analyses and maps</strong> that would be worthwhile, whether you know how to do them or not.</li>
                    <li>Without using QGIS, make a <strong>sketch</strong> of the maps you will include in the project. This could be on paper or with some other type of software. Consider the types of data you will need to do it, how the data will be layered, how you might have to modify the data, and the scale of your project. You're not limited to sketching a map here: use multiple sketches or a flowchart if it helps.</li>
                    <li>Attempt to <strong>find data</strong>. Spend at most an hour doing this. Look in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vyz1hfKn4OWW8BJA9z_VNjnE9glziQ2I4CqwPIrwksk/edit#">data resources</a> we have talked about, Google for it, and think about researchers or organizations that might have this data and how you might get in touch with them.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Submit your sketch(es) and write <strong>half a page</strong> about the project as part of your response.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Part 2: Geocoding, heat maps, or hex bins</h2>
                <p>Geocoding, heat maps, or hex bins. Pick the one that's most interesting to you and improve one of your previous maps or make a new one. If you change a previous map, compare it with the new one in your response.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
                <p><strong>Submit a PDF</strong> (exported from a drawing application or a scanned drawing) for Part 1.</p>
                <p>Use the QGIS <strong>Print Composer</strong> to create <strong>one PDF</strong> of your map from Part 2. Make sure to add map accessories such as legends, titles, and scale bars as appropriate. Refer to your sources as appropriate.</p>
                <p>Finally, include a <strong>short summary</strong> of what you did for this assignment. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>
