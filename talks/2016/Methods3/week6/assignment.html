                <h2>Part 1: Georeferencing with QGIS</h2>
                <p>Georeference an image of a map. If you don't have one in mind, use an urban renewal plan from <a href="http://www.urbanreviewer.org/#map=12/40.7400/-73.9461">Urban Reviewer</a> that has an image associated with it (eg, <a href="http://www.urbanreviewer.org/#map=16/40.7106/-73.9895&amp;plan=Two+Bridges">Two Bridges</a>) or look at <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/search/index?filters%5Btype%5D=cartographic&amp;keywords=#">the NYPL's digital collections, filtered to maps</a>.</p>
                <p>Georeference the image using QGIS. The result may not be absolutely perfect, but do get major landmarks to line up and most of the streets in line. Keep in mind that aerial imagery is often taken at an angle, so avoid using rooftops as control points.</p>
                <p>Submit a <strong>screenshot</strong> of the georeferenced image, semi-transparent, over a base layer of your choosing.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Part 2: Creating Data with QGIS</h2>
                <p>Using the georeferenced image from Part 1, create a new shapefile and trace some elements of the georeferenced image. Optionally overlay other data with your new shapefile. Use Print Composer to create a PDF of the resulting map and submit this map.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Part 3: CARTO</h2>
                <p>Next week we will start looking at CARTO. CARTO (formerly CartoDB) has likely changed significantly since you last used it, and The New School now has an agreement with the company that lets us give more space to students as needed. To take advantage of this, please create a new login with your New School email address using <a href="https://thenewschool.carto.com/signup">this link</a>. If you already have a CARTO/CartoDB account with your New School email address and the above link does not work as a result, please login to your existing account and change the email address associated with it, then try signing up again.</p>
                <p>Once you have created an account, go to your account settings,</p>
                <p><img src="img/account-settings.png" /></p>
                <p>click <strong>Account</strong>:</p>
                <p><img src="img/your-account.png" /></p>
                <p>then turn on <strong>Builder</strong>:</p>
                <p><img src="img/builder.png" /></p>
                <p>You don't have to do anything else with CARTO for now, we will start talking about it next week.</p>
