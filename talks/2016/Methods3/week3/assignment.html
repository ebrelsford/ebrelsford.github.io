                <p>Now that you have some experience in QGIS, let's expand on that by making a few common types of maps: qualitative and quantitative maps.</p>
                <p>Videos that reinforce the lecture and will be helpful with this assignment are posted below.</p>

                <h2>Resources</h2>
                <p>For choosing your data classification scheme for the second part, please refer to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/l4_p7.html#classification_schemes">The concepts page for a Penn State class on Cartography and Visualization. </a>This gets relevant around the heading "Classification Schemes," but the Choropleth Maps section is a pretty good review of what we talked about in class.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://go.owu.edu/~jbkrygie/krygier_html/geog_353/geog_353_lo/geog_353_lo07.html">Krygier's outline for his Cartography and Visualization class.</a> You can skip the sections dealing with ArcGIS and ArcView, the concepts are the important part. The classification schemes are listed under "Ideographic schemes" (search for it, it's around half of the way down the page).</li>
                    <li><a href="http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2011/10/telling-truth.html">Telling the Truth</a>, a quick look at which classification schemes work better for example distributions.</li>

            <section>
                <h2>Part 1: A Qualitative Thematic Map</h2>
                <p>Create a qualitative thematic map using QGIS and any of the data sources listed in class to make a qualitative map of NYC or another area interesting to you. The map should <strong>categorize</strong> the features and list those categories in its legend. The map should have little to do with the quantity of features and more to do with the information you know about these features. Think about the data you're using and why you are categorizing it the way you are.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Part 2: A Quantitative Thematic Map</h2>
                <p>Make one quantitative thematic map counting (or otherwise summarizing) points in polygons. Think about the colors you're using, the method you're using to classify the data. If there are outliers, consider the following: Do those outliers make sense to you? Are they a quirk of the data?</p>
                <p>Select some data source where the features are points for NYC or another area (points being something similar to Uber pickups as we looked at last week, or <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/NYC-Wi-Fi-in-the-Parks/wus9-98d5">Wifi in the Parks</a>). Using QGIS, count the number of these points in each polygon for a polygon data source (such as city council districts or census tracts) and make a choropleth map using the number of points in each polygon. We went over this briefly in class, but the video below should suffice.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
                <p>Use the QGIS <strong>Print Composer</strong> to create <strong>two PDFs</strong>: one of your map from Part 1, the other of your map from Part 2. Make sure to add map accessories such as legends, titles, and scale bars as appropriate.</p>
                <p>Finally, include a <strong>short summary</strong> (1/2 page) of what you did for this assignment. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>
                <p>In both parts I want to see that you are thinking about cartographic concepts as we discussed in Class 2 and the techniques and issues that we discussed in Class 3.</p>
