# 9. Moving forward with QGIS

This has been a very quick introduction to QGIS and hopefully you're feeling relatively comfortable with it now. As with learning anything new, there will surely be times that you need help with QGIS. Luckily there are resources online and offline that should keep you on track.

## Asking questions online

By far the most popular way to ask questions about QGIS online is [GIS Stack Exchange](http://gis.stackexchange.com/). The site lets you post a question, and others will attempt to answer your question. Everyone gets to vote on how helpful each response is, so good answers tend to bubble up to the top. You should search the site first before posting a new question.

## Asking questions in person

There is a chapter of the popular [Maptime meetup](http://maptime.io/) in New York, [Maptime NYC](http://www.meetup.com/maptime-nyc/). It's a friendly place to meet other people who work on map-related things, and many participants know their way around QGIS.

## Online resources

The [QGIS User Guide](http://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/user_manual/) is online and free.

I have posted many QGIS videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsmBq4ziqRgBZSJK8sGF0Fg) that might help you out if you're looking for visual, step-by-step directions.

## Books

Here are a few books about QGIS I would recommend:

[Learning QGIS](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-qgis-second-edition) is a basic introduction to QGIS for those looking to reinforce the topics covered in this workshop.

[Mastering QGIS](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-qgis) is an excellent book for those who are comfortable with QGIS but looking for a guide to deeper topics such as the processing toolbox and writing scripts (including plugins).

It's not out yet, but I'm looking forward to [QGIS Map Design](http://locatepress.com/qmd).

## Blogs

If you want to stay on top of QGIS development as it happens, there are some people who blog regularly about QGIS. [QGIS Planet](http://plugins.qgis.org/planet/) aggregates these blogs, but here are a few of my favorites:

 * [Anita Graser](http://anitagraser.com/)
 * [Nyall Dawson](http://nyalldawson.net/)
 * [Nathan Woodrow](http://nathanw.net/)
