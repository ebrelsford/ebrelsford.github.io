                <h2>Readings</h2>
                <p>We are going to be getting into making web pages in the next few weeks. Here are some recommended readings to prepare you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">What is Code?</a> This is a long, at times hilarious, article that was in Bloomberg Businessweek last summer. As such, it's meant for a general audience and does an interesting job of introducing readers to programming and programmers. I strongly recommend at least reading a bit of it.</li>
                    <li>Start to get used to HTML by reading <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction">Mozilla's Introduction to HTML</a>. It's okay if you're not completely comfortable with this material yet, we will talk about it more next week.</li>
                    <li>If you're interested in working ahead a bit, start working on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web">Codecademy's HTML &amp; CSS course</a>.</li>
                </ul>

<h2>Part 1: Spatial SQL</h2>
<p>Let's take another look at SQL:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2016-02-02/visualisations/listings.csv">the most recent Airbnb data</a> for NYC from Inside Airbnb. Upload it to your CartoDB account.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/City-Council-Districts/yusd-j4xi">City Council Districts</a> from the NYC OpenData portal. Upload it to your CartoDB account.</li>
<li>Write an SQL query that selects only the Airbnb listings in a City Council District of your choosing and maps them.</li>
</ol>
            </section>

<h2>Part 2: Putting things online (Neocities)</h2>
<p>We are going to be putting web pages online starting next week. Let's create a few accounts that will lay the groundwork for that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a free account at <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>.</li>
<li>Create a simple site. You <strong>do not need to touch the HTML for now</strong>.</li>
<li>Upload an image that you don't mind making public to your site.</li>
<li>Find the public link to the image by clicking on it.</li>
</ol>
            </section>

            <section>
<h2>Part 3: Putting things online (GitHub Pages)</h2>
<p>GitHub is another free way to host pages online. Learn a bit more about them with <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/11/27/github-pages-explained">this tutorial</a>. Specifically follow along starting at the heading <strong>Setting Up Your First Page</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an account at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Create a repository as specified in the tutorial. The name should be <strong>yourusername</strong>.github.io.</li>
<li>In the tutorial, the location of the <strong>Settings</strong> button has changed to be near the top of the page.</li>
<li>Pick a layout.</li>
<li>You can stop when you get to the heading <strong>Editing Your First Page</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Part 4: Make a map related to your project</h2>
<p>In CartoDB, make a map that is related to one of your project ideas. Spend some time looking for data. Focus specifically on <strong>layering data</strong> and potential <strong>SQL queries</strong> that make interesting visualizations of the data. Don't forget <strong>legends</strong>, <strong>titles</strong>, and <strong>attribution</strong> where appropriate.</p>

                <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
                <p>Part 1: Submit your SQL query and a screenshot of the result.</p>
                <p>Part 2: Submit the public link to the image.</p>
                <p>Part 3: Submit the public link to your page (<strong>yourusername</strong>.github.io).</p>
                <p>Part 4: Submit a link to your map.</p>
                <p>You may optionally choose to include a short paragraph response or summary of your work.</p>
