                <p>We talked about HTML this week, and we'll exercise some of our new knowledge around it by using HTML to customize CartoDB visualizations and make our own pages. <strong>Please do not use CSS (styles) for now. Focus on HTML for this assignment.</strong></p>

                <h2>Resources</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>My <a href="materials/html_cheatsheet.pdf">HTML Reference</a> should get you started.</li>
                    <li>If you're looking to learn HTML from another angle, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">codecademy</a> has a course in HTML that is usable and interactive.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> is a great resource for HTML and other web documentation.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/">css-tricks</a> has good beginner-to-intermediate tutorials, and you might appreciate <a href="https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/58-html-css-the-very-basics/">HTML & CSS -- The VERY Basics</a>. As stated earlier, please stick to HTML for now and we'll cover CSS next week.</li>

                <h2>Part 1: Add some HTML to a CartoDB visualization</h2>
                <p>Open a CartoDB visualization from a previous assignment and:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Edit the legend to add a link (or links) to your datasource(s).</li>
                        <li>Make a change to the HTML for the infowindows for your visualization. This can be as simple as adding <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> elements to emphasize some text, or you could link to other pages or show images.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Part 2: HTML pages with embedded CartoDB visualizations</h2>
                <p>Now we'll create an HTML page from scratch and add a CartoDB map to it.</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Create an HTML page.</li>
                    <li>Edit the HTML page:
                        <ul>
                            <li>embed the CartoDB visualization from Part 1 in the page as an <code>iframe</code></li>
                            <li>add some text</li>
                            <li>add at least one image</li>
                            <li>add at least one link</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Put the HTML page online using any method you like. The simplest way to do this is through <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, but I recommend <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Part 3: Start to copy Inside Airbnb</h2>
                <p>Over the next few weeks, we will imitate <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/new-york-city/">Inside Airbnb</a>, and we'll lay the groundwork for that here.</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Create an HTML page.</li>
                    <li>Edit the HTML page:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add a title</li>
                            <li>Add links to some other pages</li>
                            <li>Embed a CartoDB visualization using the <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">listings data for the city of your choice</a></li>
                            <li>Add a dropdown that we will use for filtering. Dropdowns are <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/references/html/tags/select/">&lt;select&gt; elements</a> in HTML. Add a few &lt;option&gt; elements with the names of a few neighborhoods in the city you chose to map the listings for. You do not have to include all of them here.</li>
                            <li>Add text where you will put the total number of rooms available by type ("entire home", "private room", "shared room"). Use SQL to determine the numbers to use here.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Put the HTML page online using <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> or <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
                <p>Submit a link to the visualization you edited in Part 1 and links to the pages you posted online for Parts 2 and 3.</p>
                <p>You may optionally choose to include a short paragraph response or summary of your work.</p>
