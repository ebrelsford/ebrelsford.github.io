            <section>
                <h2>Part 1: geojson.io</h2>
                <p>Experiment with <a href="http://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a>. Create some data, save the data as a <strong>gist</strong>, and submit the <strong>URL</strong> to the resulting gist. Your data should include at least <em>five</em> geometries and should have at least <em>one</em> attribute that is populated for each geometry (in the <strong>Table</strong> section on the right side of the site). Try including multiple geometry types and mapping something you know fairly well. For example, you could map you commute to school with significant points of interest along the way.</p>
